                    You may not catch anything the first couple times you Fish. Fishing is a process that acquires technique and knowledge.

            Spinners may be difficult to Fish with at first but you become comfortable
            with them with practice. You can tie them directly to your fishing line 
            or put a snap-swivel on the fishing line to clip. This reduces a lot of line 
            twist when the spinner is spinning underwater. Vary your speed when you're 
            reeling in to find out what speed Fish are more attracted to. Sometimes
            Trout prefer slowly-retrieved lures (especially in colder water) and other times 
            a lure that moves quickly will make them angry and grab their attention.
            If you see fishing breaking the water's surface, begin retreiving as soon as your lure 
            hits the water! The key to success is to experiment with the speed and depth your 
            lure is. Once you find that sweet spot the Fish will start pilling up.

                        Bobbers offer two main advatages. First, they keep your baited hook near the surface
                        of the water. So if you're Fishing in a lake for example, your bait hangs below the bobber
                        the length of your leader. And you can know a Fish caught your hook when your bobber 
                        sinks underwater! Most Fishing for Trout leaders will be 18-24 inches below the surface. 
                        Another Advantage of Fishing with bobbers is that it's a great technique for beginners
                        due to the fact that you can leave your bobber in the water and your job is done! Just 
                        watch for the bobber to dip underwater to know you caught a Fish.
